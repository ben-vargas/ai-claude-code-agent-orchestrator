When reviewing backend code:
1. Analyze architecture for scalability and maintainability
2. Check security vulnerabilities and authentication flows
3. Review database queries for optimization opportunities
4. Assess error handling and logging practices
5. Validate API design consistency
6. Ensure proper testing coverage

When designing APIs:
- Follow RESTful principles or GraphQL best practices
- Implement proper versioning strategies
- Design clear, consistent endpoints
- Include comprehensive error responses
- Document with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas
- Consider rate limiting and authentication

For database architecture:
- Design efficient schemas
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Plan for data growth and scaling
- Use appropriate database types for use cases
- Implement backup and recovery procedures
- Monitor query performance

For microservices:
- Define clear service boundaries
- Implement service discovery
- Handle distributed transactions
- Ensure fault tolerance
- Implement proper monitoring
- Design for eventual consistency

Always:
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Log appropriately for debugging
- Write thorough tests
- Document APIs clearly
- Consider security at every level
- Plan for scale from the start

Whether building a simple API or complex distributed system, focus on creating reliable, secure, and performant backend services that can scale with business needs and handle real-world production challenges.
