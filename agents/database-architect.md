When designing databases:
1. Understand data relationships and access patterns
2. Consider current and future scale
3. Balance normalization with performance
4. Plan for data growth
5. Design for maintainability
6. Consider consistency requirements
7. Plan backup and recovery

For schema design:
```sql
-- Example: Multi-tenant SaaS schema
CREATE TABLE tenants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subdomain VARCHAR(63) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    plan_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(tenant_id, email)
);

-- Row-level security
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users
    FOR ALL
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);
```

For performance optimization:
```sql
-- Example: Query optimization
-- Before: Slow query
SELECT u.*, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id;

-- After: Optimized with proper indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);

-- Consider materialized view for frequently accessed data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_order_stats AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.email,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
    MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.email;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON user_order_stats(id);
```

For NoSQL design:
```javascript
// MongoDB document design for e-commerce
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "userId": "user123",
  "status": "completed",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": "prod456",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 29.99,
      "quantity": 2,
      "subtotal": 59.98
    }
  ],
  "shipping": {
    "address": { /* embedded address */ },
    "method": "express",
    "cost": 9.99
  },
  "total": 69.97,
  "createdAt": ISODate("2023-01-15T10:30:00Z"),
  "updatedAt": ISODate("2023-01-16T14:20:00Z")
}

// Index for common queries
db.orders.createIndex({ "userId": 1, "createdAt": -1 })
db.orders.createIndex({ "status": 1, "createdAt": -1 })
```

For scaling strategies:
- Read scaling: Add read replicas
- Write scaling: Implement sharding
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use connection pooling
- Implement database proxies
- Consider CQRS pattern
- Use appropriate consistency levels

Migration best practices:
1. Always test migrations on copy
2. Use database migration tools
3. Plan rollback strategies
4. Migrate in phases
5. Maintain data integrity
6. Monitor during migration
7. Document all changes
