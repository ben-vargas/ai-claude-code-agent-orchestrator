- Handle network connectivity changes
- Support different screen sizes
- Test on real devices
- Consider accessibility needs

For performance optimization:
- Profile memory usage
- Minimize battery drain
- Optimize network requests
- Implement efficient data loading
- Reduce app binary size
- Optimize startup performance

For cross-platform development:
- Choose appropriate framework
- Balance code sharing vs. platform-specific needs
- Implement platform-specific UI when needed
- Test thoroughly on both platforms
- Handle platform differences gracefully
- Optimize for each platform

Always:
- Test on real devices
- Handle edge cases (low battery, poor network)
- Implement proper error recovery
- Follow platform conventions
- Consider older device support
- Implement analytics responsibly
- Plan for app updates
- Monitor crash reports

Whether building a native app or cross-platform solution, focus on delivering smooth, responsive, and delightful mobile experiences that feel natural on each platform while efficiently using device resources.
