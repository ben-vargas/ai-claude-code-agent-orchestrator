For SaaS pricing optimization:
```python
# Example: Pricing tier optimization
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

class PricingOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, historical_data):
        self.data = historical_data
        self.elasticity = self.calculate_elasticity()
    
    def calculate_elasticity(self):
        # Price elasticity of demand
        price_changes = np.diff(self.data['price']) / self.data['price'][:-1]
        quantity_changes = np.diff(self.data['conversions']) / self.data['conversions'][:-1]
        return np.mean(quantity_changes / price_changes)
    
    def optimize_tiers(self, features, costs):
        tiers = []
        
        # Basic tier (high volume, low margin)
        basic_price = costs['basic'] * 1.5
        basic_features = features[:3]
        
        # Professional tier (balanced)
        pro_price = costs['pro'] * 2.5
        pro_features = features[:7]
        
        # Enterprise tier (low volume, high margin)
        enterprise_price = costs['enterprise'] * 4
        enterprise_features = features
        
        # Apply psychological pricing
        basic_price = self.apply_charm_pricing(basic_price)
        pro_price = self.apply_anchor_pricing(pro_price, basic_price)
        enterprise_price = self.apply_premium_pricing(enterprise_price)
        
        return {
            'basic': {'price': basic_price, 'features': basic_features},
            'pro': {'price': pro_price, 'features': pro_features},
            'enterprise': {'price': enterprise_price, 'features': enterprise_features}
        }
    
    def apply_charm_pricing(self, price):
        # 9-ending pricing
        return int(price) - 0.01 if price > 10 else round(price, 2)
    
    def apply_anchor_pricing(self, price, anchor):
        # Make pro tier look attractive compared to basic
        target_multiple = 2.2  # Psychology: not quite 2.5x
        return round(anchor * target_multiple, -1) - 1
```

For dynamic pricing:
```python
# Example: Dynamic pricing algorithm
class DynamicPricer:
    def __init__(self, base_price, min_price, max_price):
        self.base_price = base_price
        self.min_price = min_price
        self.max_price = max_price
        self.price_history = []
    
    def calculate_price(self, demand_factors):
        # Factors: time, inventory, competition, demand
        time_factor = self.time_based_factor(demand_factors['hour'])
        demand_factor = self.demand_based_factor(demand_factors['current_demand'])
        inventory_factor = self.inventory_factor(demand_factors['available_inventory'])
        competition_factor = self.competition_factor(demand_factors['competitor_prices'])
        
        # Weighted price calculation
        price_multiplier = (
            time_factor * 0.2 +
            demand_factor * 0.4 +
            inventory_factor * 0.2 +
            competition_factor * 0.2
        )
        
        dynamic_price = self.base_price * price_multiplier
        
        # Ensure within bounds
        dynamic_price = max(self.min_price, min(self.max_price, dynamic_price))
        
        # Smooth price changes
        if self.price_history:
            last_price = self.price_history[-1]
            max_change = last_price * 0.15  # Max 15% change
            if abs(dynamic_price - last_price) > max_change:
                dynamic_price = last_price + np.sign(dynamic_price - last_price) * max_change
        
        self.price_history.append(dynamic_price)
        return round(dynamic_price, 2)
```

For A/B testing:
```python
# Example: Price A/B testing framework
class PriceABTest:
    def __init__(self, control_price, test_prices, min_sample_size=1000):
        self.control_price = control_price
        self.test_prices = test_prices
        self.min_sample_size = min_sample_size
        self.results = {}
    
    def run_test(self, traffic_allocation):
        # Allocate traffic to different price points
        for price in [self.control_price] + self.test_prices:
            self.results[price] = {
                'visitors': 0,
                'conversions': 0,
                'revenue': 0
            }
    
    def calculate_significance(self, control_data, test_data):
        # Statistical significance calculation
        from scipy import stats
        
        control_rate = control_data['conversions'] / control_data['visitors']
        test_rate = test_data['conversions'] / test_data['visitors']
        
        # Z-test for conversion rate
        z_score = (test_rate - control_rate) / np.sqrt(
            control_rate * (1 - control_rate) / control_data['visitors'] +
            test_rate * (1 - test_rate) / test_data['visitors']
        )
        
        p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(z_score)))
        return p_value < 0.05  # 95% confidence
```
