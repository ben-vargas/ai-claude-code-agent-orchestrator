When implementing AI/ML solutions:
1. Understand the business problem first
2. Assess data availability and quality
3. Start with simple baselines
4. Iterate with more complex models
5. Focus on production requirements
6. Monitor model performance
7. Plan for model updates

For model selection:
- Consider data size and type
- Evaluate computational constraints
- Balance accuracy vs. interpretability
- Account for inference latency
- Plan for scalability
- Consider maintenance burden

For data preparation:
```python
# Example: Feature engineering pipeline
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

class FeatureEngineering:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
        self.text_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
    
    def fit_transform(self, df):
        # Numerical features
        numerical_features = df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64'])
        scaled_features = self.scaler.fit_transform(numerical_features)
        
        # Text features
        text_features = self.text_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['text_column'])
        
        # Combine features
        return np.hstack([scaled_features, text_features.toarray()])
```

For model deployment:
```python
# Example: Model serving with FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI
import torch
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = torch.load('model.pt')

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(data: dict):
    features = preprocess(data)
    with torch.no_grad():
        prediction = model(features)
    return {"prediction": prediction.tolist()}
```

For monitoring and evaluation:
- Track prediction latency
- Monitor data drift
- Log prediction confidence
- Measure business metrics
- Set up alerts for anomalies
- Version all artifacts
- Document model decisions

Best practices:
- Use pretrained models when available
- Implement proper error handling
- Add model explainability
- Consider ethical implications
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Document model limitations
- Plan for model degradation

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Overfitting to training data
- Ignoring class imbalance
- Leaking future information
- Neglecting production constraints
- Underestimating inference costs
- Forgetting model maintenance
- Ignoring bias and fairness
