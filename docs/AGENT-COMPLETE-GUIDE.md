## Advanced Orchestration {#advanced-orchestration}

### Multi-Agent Evaluation

When the orchestration agent is uncertain, it runs parallel evaluations:

```python
# Example: Choosing database architecture
task = "Design database for 10M users, complex queries"

agents_to_test = [
    "database-architect",
    "backend-expert", 
    "cloud-architect"
]

evaluation_criteria = {
    "scalability": 0.35,
    "query_performance": 0.30,
    "cost_efficiency": 0.20,
    "implementation_complexity": 0.15
}

# Results might show:
# - database-architect: Best for complex query optimization
# - cloud-architect: Best for distributed scaling
# - Recommendation: Use both in collaboration
```

### Learning & Adaptation

The system learns from every project:

```sql
-- Performance tracking
INSERT INTO agent_performance (
    task_type, agent_name, success_score, completion_time
) VALUES 
    ('api_design', 'backend-expert', 0.92, 240),
    ('api_design', 'cloud-architect', 0.78, 480);

-- Pattern recognition
SELECT agent_name, AVG(success_score) as avg_score
FROM agent_performance
WHERE task_type = 'api_design'
GROUP BY agent_name
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```

### Suggesting New Agents

When existing agents underperform, the system suggests specializations:

```json
{
  "identified_gap": "Real-time video streaming architecture",
  "current_best_score": 0.65,
  "suggested_agent": {
    "name": "streaming-media-expert",
    "expertise": ["WebRTC", "HLS", "CDN optimization", "Live streaming"],
    "justification": "Frequent requests for video features with suboptimal results"
  }
}
```

## Agent Collaboration Patterns {#collaboration-patterns}

### Pattern 1: Pipeline
```
Research → Design → Build → Test → Deploy
(analyst)  (ui/ux)  (devs)  (qa)  (devops)
```

### Pattern 2: Hub & Spoke
```
         product-strategy
        /       |        \
   ui/ux    backend    marketing
      \        |        /
         customer-success
```

### Pattern 3: Paired Programming
```
backend-expert + security-specialist → Secure APIs
frontend-expert + performance-engineer → Fast UI
database-architect + ai-ml-expert → ML Feature Store
```

### Pattern 4: Swarm Intelligence
For complex problems, multiple agents work simultaneously:
```
Problem: "Scale to 1M concurrent users"

Swarm:
- cloud-architect: Infrastructure design
- database-architect: Data partitioning
- performance-engineer: Bottleneck analysis
- devops-sre-expert: Auto-scaling rules
- security-specialist: DDoS protection
```

## Optimization & Learning {#optimization-learning}

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Task completion times
   - Quality scores
   - Customer satisfaction
   - Revenue impact

2. **Agent Selection Optimization**:
   ```python
   if task.similarity_to_previous > 0.8:
       use_previous_agent_selection()
   else:
       run_multi_agent_evaluation()
   ```

3. **Feedback Loops**:
   - User rates agent outputs
   - Agents learn from ratings
   - Orchestration improves routing

### Cost Optimization

Balancing quality with efficiency:

```yaml
optimization_strategies:
  - parallel_execution: Reduce total time by 40%
  - agent_specialization: Improve quality by 25%
  - caching_insights: Reuse analysis for similar tasks
  - incremental_updates: Only engage agents for changes
```
