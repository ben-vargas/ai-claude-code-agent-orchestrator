# Agent Collaboration Example: Building a New SaaS Product

This example demonstrates how the orchestration agent coordinates multiple specialized agents to build and launch a new SaaS product.

## Project: Task Management SaaS for Remote Teams

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Parallel Execution)

The orchestration agent initiates three parallel workstreams:

```yaml
orchestration_plan:
  project_id: "SAAS-20250129-001"
  parallel_tasks:
    - agent: business-analyst
      task: "Market analysis and competitive research"
      deliverables: ["market-size.md", "competitor-matrix.xlsx"]
      
    - agent: product-strategy-expert  
      task: "Define MVP features and pricing strategy"
      deliverables: ["mvp-features.md", "pricing-models.md"]
      
    - agent: uiux-expert
      task: "User research and initial wireframes"
      deliverables: ["user-personas.md", "wireframes.fig"]
```

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture (Sequential + Parallel)

Based on Phase 1 outputs:

```yaml
phase_2:
  sequential:
    - agent: cloud-architect
      task: "Design scalable cloud infrastructure"
      dependencies: ["mvp-features.md"]
      deliverables: ["architecture-diagram.md", "service-map.yaml"]
      
  parallel_after_architecture:
    - agent: backend-expert
      task: "API design and database schema"
      deliverables: ["api-spec.yaml", "database-schema.sql"]
      
    - agent: devops-sre-expert
      task: "CI/CD pipeline setup"
      deliverables: ["github-actions.yaml", "deployment-guide.md"]
      
    - agent: cloud-security-auditor
      task: "Security assessment and compliance check"
      deliverables: ["security-report.md", "compliance-checklist.md"]
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (Coordinated Parallel)

```yaml
phase_3:
  coordinated_parallel:
    backend_team:
      - agent: backend-expert
        task: "Implement core API and business logic"
        
    frontend_team:
      - agent: frontend-expert
        task: "Build React dashboard"
        
      - agent: mobile-expert
        task: "Develop mobile app"
        
    quality_team:
      - agent: qa-test-engineer
        task: "Create test automation suite"
        
    data_team:
      - agent: data-analytics-expert
        task: "Implement analytics and tracking"
```

### Phase 4: Go-to-Market (Parallel)

```yaml
phase_4:
  parallel_gtm:
    - agent: marketing-expert
      task: "Launch campaign and content strategy"
      
    - agent: customer-success-expert
      task: "Design onboarding flow and support docs"
      
    - agent: social-media-expert
      task: "Social media launch strategy"
      
    - agent: business-operations-expert
      task: "Set up billing and subscription management"
```

## Agent Output Examples

### Business Analyst Output
```json
{
  "agent": "business-analyst",
  "taskId": "BUSA-20250129-0001",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Completed market analysis for task management SaaS",
  "outputs": {
    "insights": [
      "Market size: $4.3B growing at 12% CAGR",
      "Key competitors: Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp",
      "Underserved niche: Remote teams under 50 people"
    ],
    "deliverables": [
      {
        "type": "analysis",
        "path": "/analysis/market-research-2025.md",
        "description": "Comprehensive market analysis"
      }
    ]
  },
  "suggestedAgents": [
    {
      "agent": "product-strategy-expert",
      "reason": "Define product positioning based on market gaps",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Orchestration Agent Monitoring
```json
{
  "project_status": {
    "overall_progress": 35,
    "phase": 2,
    "active_agents": 4,
    "blocked_tasks": 1,
    "critical_path": ["backend-api", "frontend-dashboard", "qa-testing"]
  },
  "optimizations_applied": [
    "Parallelized independent design tasks",
    "Pre-allocated cloud resources during development",
    "Staged rollout plan to reduce risk"
  ],
  "risk_mitigation": [
    "Identified dependency: Frontend blocked until API spec complete",
    "Suggested: Start with mock API to unblock frontend"
  ]
}
```

## Benefits of Orchestration

1. **Efficiency**: Parallel execution reduces time from 6 months to 3 months
2. **Quality**: Each specialist focuses on their expertise area
3. **Coordination**: Dependencies managed proactively
4. **Visibility**: Real-time progress tracking across all agents
5. **Optimization**: Continuous improvement of workflows

## Tool/MCP Integration

The orchestration leverages various tools:
- **Task Management MCP**: Tracks all agent tasks
- **Code Repository MCP**: Manages deliverables
- **Communication Hub MCP**: Inter-agent messaging
- **Analytics Dashboard MCP**: Project metrics
- **Resource Monitor MCP**: Cloud resource usage

This orchestrated approach ensures efficient, high-quality delivery of complex projects through intelligent agent coordination.
