# ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGEROUS RULES - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® CRITICAL WARNING üö®

These Claude Code rules files are designed for **CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS ONLY** and provide agents with extensive permissions that could:

- **DELETE OR MODIFY ANY FILES** on your system
- **EXECUTE SYSTEM COMMANDS** with minimal restrictions
- **ACCESS NETWORK RESOURCES** without approval
- **INSTALL OR REMOVE SOFTWARE** without confirmation
- **MODIFY SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS** automatically

## ‚õî DISCLAIMER

**BY USING THESE RULES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:**

1. **YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE** for any damage, data loss, or security breaches
2. **W4M.AI AND CONTRIBUTORS PROVIDE NO WARRANTY** and accept no liability
3. **THESE FILES ARE EXAMPLES ONLY** for demonstration in isolated environments
4. **YOU SHOULD NEVER USE THESE** on production systems or with sensitive data
5. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED** about the potential risks

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures

While these rules are permissive, they still block the most catastrophic commands:

### Blocked Patterns:
- `rm -rf /` and variants
- `rm -rf /*`
- `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda` (disk wiping)
- `:(){ :|:& };:` (fork bombs)
- `chmod -R 000 /`
- `mkfs` commands on system drives
- `> /dev/sda` (direct disk writes)

## üìÅ Available Rule Sets

### 1. `permissive-dev-rules.json`
- For development environments
- Allows file operations without confirmation
- Permits package installation
- Enables git operations freely

### 2. `automation-rules.json`
- For CI/CD and automation
- Allows unattended execution
- Permits system modifications
- Enables service management

### 3. `research-rules.json`
- For research and experimentation
- Allows broad file system access
- Permits network operations
- Enables data collection

## üîß Installation (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**DO NOT INSTALL THESE IN YOUR MAIN CLAUDE CODE CONFIGURATION**

If you absolutely must use these in an isolated environment:

```bash
# Create an isolated Claude Code profile
mkdir -p ~/.claude-dangerous/rules

# Copy the rules you need
cp dangerous-rules/permissive-dev-rules.json ~/.claude-dangerous/rules/

# Run Claude Code with alternate config
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-dangerous claude
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Better Alternatives

Instead of using these dangerous rules, consider:

1. **Using Docker/VMs**: Run agents in isolated containers
2. **Temporary Environments**: Use cloud workspaces that can be destroyed
3. **Granular Permissions**: Create specific rules for your use case
4. **Human Oversight**: Keep confirmation prompts for critical operations

## üìù Example Use Cases

These rules were created for:
- Automated testing in disposable VMs
- Research in sandboxed environments  
- Development on isolated machines
- Demonstration purposes only

**Remember**: With great power comes great responsibility. These rules remove many safety guards. Use them only when you fully understand and accept the risks.
