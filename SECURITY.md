# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously at W4M.ai. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Claude Code Agent Orchestrator, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: security@w4m.ai
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Time

- We aim to acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- We'll notify you when the issue is resolved

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - API keys, tokens, or credentials
   - Personal information
   - Internal URLs or endpoints
   - Database connection strings

2. **Use environment variables** for any configuration that varies by environment

3. **Review the .gitignore** before committing to ensure sensitive files are excluded

4. **Scan dependencies** before adding new packages

### For Users

1. **Keep Claude Code updated** to the latest version
2. **Review agent permissions** before installation
3. **Don't modify agents to include credentials**
4. **Use secure storage** for any API keys referenced by agents

## Security Features

### What We Do

- ✅ Regular security audits of the codebase
- ✅ No storage of user credentials or sensitive data
- ✅ Clear separation between configuration and code
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive files
- ✅ Safe installation scripts with validation

### What We Don't Do

- ❌ We don't collect or transmit user data
- ❌ We don't store API keys or credentials
- ❌ We don't execute arbitrary code
- ❌ We don't make network requests to external services

## Dependency Security

Currently, this project has no external dependencies, which minimizes the attack surface. If dependencies are added in the future:

1. All dependencies will be scanned for vulnerabilities
2. Regular updates will be performed
3. Security advisories will be monitored

## Code of Conduct

Security researchers are expected to:
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Not access or modify other users' data
- Not perform attacks on W4M.ai infrastructure
- Act in good faith to help improve security

## Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep our project safe. With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution in our release notes.
