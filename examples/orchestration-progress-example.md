# Orchestration Progress Example

This example demonstrates how the enhanced orchestration agent manages a Level 3 (Alpha Production) project with interactive mode enabled.

## User Request

"I want to build a SaaS tool for automated social media scheduling with AI-powered content suggestions. Level 3 quality, and I'd like interactive mode so I can guide decisions."

## Orchestration Response

### Initial Setup

```
🎭 ORCHESTRATION AGENT v2
========================

I'll help you build an AI-powered social media scheduling SaaS at Level 3 (Alpha Production) quality.

Since you've enabled interactive mode, I'll ask some questions to better understand your needs before creating the execution plan.

   > "Small businesses struggle to maintain consistent social media presence"

2. Who is your target audience?
   > "Small to medium businesses, 10-100 employees, especially e-commerce"

3. What does success look like?
   > "1000 paying customers in 6 months, $50K MRR"

💻 TECHNICAL PREFERENCES
1. Preferred tech stack?
   > "Modern and scalable, I'm flexible but prefer React frontend"

2. Existing systems to integrate?
   > "Need to integrate with Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter APIs"

3. Cloud provider preference?
   > "AWS, we have credits"

📊 QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
1. Expected concurrent users?
   > "Up to 500 concurrent users"

2. Performance requirements?
   > "Sub-second response times, real-time preview"

3. Compliance needs?

Overall: [███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 5% (1/19 agents)

Now starting: competitive-intelligence-expert
```

### Interactive Decision Point

After Phase 1:

```
🎭 PHASE 1 COMPLETE - DECISION REQUIRED
======================================

Phase 1 Summary:
✅ All research agents completed successfully
⏱️ Time: 1 hour 23 minutes (7 min under estimate)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. 📊 Market Opportunity: $2.3B market, growing 18% annually
2. 🤖 AI Differentiator: No competitor has robust AI content generation
3. 💰 Pricing: Competitors range $29-299/month
4. ⚠️ CHALLENGE: Social platform APIs becoming more restrictive

CRITICAL DECISION: AI Implementation Strategy

Our ai-ml-expert identified three approaches:

┌─────────────────────┬─────────────┬───────────┬─────────────┐
│ Option              │ Cost/Month  │ Quality   │ Time to MVP │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────┼───────────┼─────────────┤
│ A. OpenAI GPT-4     │ $2000-5000  │ Excellent │ 2 weeks     │
│ B. Open Source LLM  │ $500-1000   │ Good      │ 4 weeks     │
│ C. Hybrid Approach  │ $1000-2000  │ Very Good │ 3 weeks     │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┘

Option C Details (Recommended):
- Use GPT-3.5 for bulk generation
- GPT-4 for premium users only
- Cache common suggestions
- Fine-tune smaller model over time

📌 Recommendation: C - Hybrid Approach
Your choice? (A/B/C or 'details' for more info):

⏱️ Auto-proceeding with C in 5 minutes...
[████████████░░░░░░░░░░░] 3:47 remaining

> C

✅ Decision recorded: Hybrid AI approach selected
⏱️ Response time: 1 min 13 sec

Shall we proceed to Phase 2 (Architecture & Design)?
[Y/n] (auto-proceed with Y in 2 minutes)
> Y
```

### Timeout Scenario Example

When user doesn't respond:

```
🎭 DECISION REQUIRED - ARCHITECTURE APPROACH
==========================================

Based on Phase 2 analysis, we need to decide on the architecture pattern:

Options:
A) Microservices - Maximum scalability, higher complexity
B) Modular Monolith - Balanced approach, easier deployment
C) Traditional Monolith - Fastest to market, limited scale

Analysis Summary:
- Team size: Small (3-5 developers)
- Timeline: 3 months
- Scale requirement: 500 concurrent users

📌 Recommendation: B - Modular Monolith
Your choice?

⏱️ Auto-proceeding with B in 5 minutes...
[████████████████░░░░░░] 0:45 remaining

⏱️ Auto-proceeding with B in 5 minutes...
[████████████████████░░] 0:15 remaining

⏱️ Auto-proceeding with B in 5 minutes...
[██████████████████████] 0:00 - TIMEOUT

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⏱️ TIMEOUT: Auto-proceeding with recommended option
Decision: B - Modular Monolith
Reason: No user response within 5 minute timeout
Time waited: 5 minutes 0 seconds
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Proceeding with Modular Monolith architecture...

### Level-Based Adjustments

For Level 3, the orchestration:
- Includes QA and security agents
- Allocates time for proper testing
- Ensures documentation is created
- Implements monitoring and logging
- Focuses on 500+ user scalability

If this were Level 1 (MVP), it would:
- Skip performance-engineer
- Minimize security-specialist involvement  
- Use basic UI components
- Deploy simple architecture
- Target 10-50 users initially
